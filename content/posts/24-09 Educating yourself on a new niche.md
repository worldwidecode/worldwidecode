## Educating yourself on a new niche

Whenever I find myself in a new opportunity in an industry or niche I am unfamiliar with, **I first *calibrate* myself** by finding two answers:

1. What skills I can already bring to the table today
2. What I need to learn to be able to apply these skills

When asking the second question, **it is useful to *first* take the perspective of the end-customer before diving into the supply-side specifics.**

`What is it that they really want out of the arrangement? How much effort do they need to expend right now to solve this problem?`

It is important to take the perspective of the end-customer first so you don't end up falling into the trap of finding a problem for your solution.

**Do the opposite: find the solution for ‘a’ problem.** This is one of the keys of being able to communicate effectively in good marketing. It follows the *logical, chronological, and causal* chain that ends up connecting with your customer and that makes them have that **"aha!"** moment where things click and makes sense.

***If you start questioning things from the supplier-side first, you're inherently more likely to start looking for confirmation bias.***

This brings me to my main point:

`The order in which you learn, and think over things is important.`

Similar to how you would take a college course that graduates you from Algebra I to Algebra II, **educating yourself on a new niche needs you to think things over in terms of *the structure that is going to benefit your* lasting *learning before diving in.***

Generally speaking, you want to start with as many fundamentals as possible to build a solid foundation. Doing this, I find it important to be able to have a ***tangible understanding*** of the industry and niche is.

If you find yourself in heavy machinery, it will be useful for you to view some videos of how they are used in action. **Our brains can have a difficult time processing abstract concepts,** and keeping them so is not to your long-term benefit.

Alongside that, ***I would follow your natural curiosity.*** What are the questions that some part of you wants answered, **even if you're not sure why?** Our natural curiosity stems from a part of us that is hunkering to make connections to put things into perspective and a way that we can understand.

**Try to always grow properly towards complex topics, taking the right steps to be able to truly understand them.**

`You are better off integrating knowledge, taking its high-level lessons with you as part of your general understanding, than desperately trying to cling onto individual factoids.`

Divide your understanding into two different categories:

1. What do I need to know to move forward today
2. What do I need to learn tomorrow

Then, just start.
